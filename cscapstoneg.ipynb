The first process is obtaining an item of interest from the user. Since this is content based filtering, we do not understand at the moment what the user likes. To kickstart our machine learning application our prescriptive method will require initial input of what the user 'might' be interested in. From here we can compare the similarities using machine learning to offer the top 10 items within our product list that will align closely with the user's interests. </p>"

    "The Descriptive models shown above lets us know how the model is performing at any given time. The data outlined is organized to show us the accuracy of the machine learning algorithm. The first two results visualizations classify and categorize the similarity rankings of the final result across 4 containers. The final visualization is a histogram representing the results data distribution. If results are not satisfactory for business performance we can easily extend further training on the model to optimize the results or fine tune the model in one direction or another. Having the descriptive performance display will allow us to determine strengths and weaknesses as we work to increase sales. Following the descriptive models and visualizations, a descriptive method was provided. Information that describes the features we found within the data that describe what information we are seeking was extracted from the complete dataset.
